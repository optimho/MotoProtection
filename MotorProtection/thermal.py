"""
This is to calculate a typical thermal time to trip for an old relay called the RAMDE
But most motor curves follow should follow the same algo. we are using the calculation to calculate and test
an modern ABB REM615 that is replacing that relay
It takes in a few arguments

-tau = the thermal time constant of a motor
-i = actual current injected
-ip = previous current - running at that for longer than 5 x tau so that the temperature is stable .
-ib = the rated current of the motor, the name plate current / ct ratio
-k = security factor, set to 1.02 if not sepecified

A usage example is:

In our example we have chosen a thermal time constant of 120s
The motor is a 132A motor and the cell has a CT ratio of 200, so 0.67
we will do the calculation with no pre load so a cold motor defaults to Ip = 0 if not specified
we will test an overload of 2 x Ib
python thermal.py -tau 120 -i 1.34 -ip 0 -ib 0.67 -k 1.02

If one has previous current flowing for a good amount of time, like 5 x tau then add -ib
python thermal.py -tau 120 -i 2.01 -ip 0.670 -ib 0.67 -k 1.02
